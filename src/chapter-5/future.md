# Future Work
As described out in my conclusion, digital exams are important and so is making
them secure. This is not work that can be done overnight, and requires both time
and resources. Both Safe Exam Browser and Inspera Assessment is being developed
actively, and over time what exploits works against them will likely change.
It's entirely possible that in closing one security vulnerability, another one
opens that nobody discovered, therefore it's important to keep testing future
versions of the software.

Another research inquiry that Inspera Assessment is looking into is applying AI
techniques like big data classification to attempt to automatically detect when
a student is engaged in suspicion activity. In the beginning, this is likely to
cover simple things like if a user copies large amounts of text into the exam
during a short time-frame that will be seen as suspicious, and might need
further investigation. AIs have the ability to discover patterns and
correlations that are completely invisible to humans, and if such a system could
be created it could potentially lead to digital exams being more cheating
resilient than traditional pen and paper exams.
