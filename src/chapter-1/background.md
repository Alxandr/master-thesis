# Background
Digital exams in and of themselves is not a new concept. The fact that we do everything else on a 
computer nowdays inevetably leads to the desire for the exams themselves to be done digitally.
Digital exams comes with several advantages over pen and paper exams. Some of these advantages 
include but are not limited to [@eexamiprov]:

* People might be more used to writing on computers than with pen and paper.
* No need to use large amounts of paper for the exams . Both the questions and answers are provided
  digitally, instead of using what is probably thousands of pieces of paper per exam.
* Remove posibility of exam papers getting lost, wrong papers (like the answers instead of the
  questions) being given to the students.
* A lot of user errors might become impossible when a computer system can dictate what action can
  be done at what time.

However, just because digital exams can provide advantages over pen and paper exams does not mean
that they are the final solution to the exam problem, and simply making the exams digital would
solve all problems exams today faces. While it is true that a good amount of problems with pen and
paper exams might be mitigated by making them digital, digital exams provide their own set of
challenges and issues. Some of these are simply new logistical challenges like the fact that all
students are suddenly required to have a laptop available for taking the exam (something that most
people do have today, but nontheless it might exclude some people). Another issue is that the
software used for the exams (Safe Exam Browser) does not currently support linux, meaning that
people who do use linux on their computers (which in university students is probably a lot higher
than most crowds) might have problems taking the exams. Another issue is the fact that the exams
can only be held in a room with enough power outlets for all the students. Other errors might include:

* Power outage. Exams might not be doable because of a power outage preventing people from using
  their computers. Today however this is highly unlikely, not to mention the fact that even though
  it is technically doable, one might not want to do pen and paper exams during a power outage either.
* Internet failure. Same as with power outage, if the internet is down for some reason then exams
  cannot be executed. This is slightly more likely than a power outage, but still higly improbably
  in Norway today. However, this is something which could make digital exams impossible to perform
  while having no impact at all on pen and paper exams.
* Software failure. Problems with the LMS (Inspera Assessment in the case of NTNU) can result in
  people being unable to take the exam, or worse displacement/mismanagement of the results. It could
  also result in people being given the wrong exams or no exam at all. And if the LMS had a security
  breach, a student might be able to alter his/her responses after the exam has ended (when said
  student has regained access to the course book and/or other learning material).

Another very real issue with digital exams is that they introduce new ways by which students might
attempt to cheat at exams, which is mainly what I'll be looking at in this paper.
