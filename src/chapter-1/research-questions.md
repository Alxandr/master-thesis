# Research Questions
The goal of this master thesis is to look at different ways a student can
practically cheat at a digital exam at NTNU. The main focus will be trying to
access resources that is disallowed during exams, such as pre-made notes, online
resources such as Wikipedia, or communication resources such as chat. I also
consider it important that any exploit I discover is not only reliable but also
hard to discover.
