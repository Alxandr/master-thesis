# Research Questions {#sec:rq}
The goal of this master thesis is to look at different ways a student can
practically cheat at a digital exam at NTNU. The main focus will be trying to
access resources that is disallowed during exams, such as pre-made notes, online
resources such as Wikipedia, or communication resources such as chat. I also
consider it important that any exploit I discover is not only reliable but also
hard to discover.

RQ1
: What are technical cheating vulnerabilities of the digital exam solution
  employed by NTNU?

RQ2
: What are some new challenges/changes in routine required by digital exams
  that could allow students to cheat?

**RQ1** relates to attempting to work around the security features in place by
Safe Exam Browser and Inspera Assessment, attempting to get access to resources
I should not have access to during the exam. With regards to **RQ2** it is
likely to end up mostly as literary studies. However, if time permits I would
like to perform some experiments with real exam invigilators and fake exams,
though this will likely be left to future works.
