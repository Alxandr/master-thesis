# Research Questions {#sec:rq}
The goal of this master thesis is to look at different ways a student can
practically cheat at a digital exam at NTNU. The main focus will be trying to
access resources that are disallowed during exams, such as pre-made notes,
online resources such as Wikipedia, or communication resources such as chat. I
also consider it important that any exploit I discover is not only reliable but
also hard to discover.

RQ1
: What are technical cheating vulnerabilities of the digital exam solution
  employed by NTNU?

RQ2
: How can the ability for students to cheat during digital exam solutions be
  reduced sufficiently so that digital exams are no more vulnerable to cheating
  than their pen-and-paper counterpart?

**RQ1** relates to attempting to work around the security features in place by
Safe Exam Browser and Inspera Assessment, attempting to get access to resources
I should not have access to during the exam. With regards to **RQ2** it will to
some extend depend on what is discovered during **RQ1**.
