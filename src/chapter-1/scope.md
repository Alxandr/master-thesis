# Scope of the Thesis
In this paper I will look at possible security exploits within the exam setup
used by NTNU. I will mostly be looking at Inspera Assessment and the 
interactions between the Inspera LMS and SEB. I will not be attempting to do any
data break in at Inspera or other disruptive actions that would potentially
affect an exam like a Denial of Service attack (DoS) or the more common
Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS). I will also not be attempting to
get access to any resources from Inspera that I as a student taking an exam
should not have access to, with the exception of attempting to access the exam
itself from an unsafe environment.

I will look at both technical and non-technical solutions to cheat at digital
exams as they are held today at NTNU mainly with the goal of accessing resources
I should not have access to during the exam.
