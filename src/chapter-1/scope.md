# Scope of the Thesis
In this paper I will look at possible security exploits within the exam setup
used by NTNU. I will mostly be looking at Inspera Assessment and the 
interactions between the Inspera LMS and SEB. I will not be attempting to do any
data break in at Inspera or other disruptive actions that would potentially
affect an exam like a Denial of Service attack (DoS) or the more common
Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS).
