Eventually, it's likely that most, if not all exams held by universities in
Norway, and likely also around the world, will be entirely digital. This changes
the well known formula of paper and pen exams, and introduces new uncertainties
to exams. While pen and paper exams has been tried and tested over the ages,
digital exams are still a fairly new concept. Not to mention the fact that while
there are probably multiple ways one can do pen and paper exams, the paths one
can take towards digital exams are fairly limitless. Do one make your own
solution? Do you buy somebody else's? Or do you hire a contractor to figure the
whole thing out? Each of these have advantages and disadvantages. NTNU has opted
for a solution using Safe Exam Browser (SEB) to ensure that students cannot
access other resources available on their own computers, and Inspera Assessment
(Inspera) to do the presentation of exams and collection of exam results.

There are already several studies [@seb1, @seb2] looking at how secure SEB is.
