Eventually, it's likely that most, if not all exams held by universities in
Norway, and likely also around the world, will be entirely digital. This changes
the well known formula of paper and pen exams, and introduces new uncertainties
to exams. While pen and paper exams has been tried and tested over the ages,
digital exams are still a fairly new concept. Not to mention the fact that while
there are probably multiple ways one can do pen and paper exams, the paths one
can take towards digital exams are fairly limitless. Do one make your own
solution? Do you buy somebody else's? Or do you hire a contractor to figure the
whole thing out? Each of these have advantages and disadvantages. NTNU has opted
for a solution using Safe Exam Browser (SEB) to ensure that students cannot
access other resources available on their own computers, and Inspera Assessment
(Inspera) to do the presentation of exams and collection of exam results.

There are already several studies [@Søgaard2015][@Søgaard2016] looking at how
secure SEB is. However, this is only one part of the solution selected by NTNU
in their digital exam solution and there are other parts that needs to be
assessed as well.

Digital exams are also a challenge in and of themselves simply because they are
new. When something has been done for ages everyone knows how it works. The
students knows what to expect, the invigilators knows what to check and the
teachers knows how to write the exams. With digital exams some, if not all of
these changes. Just a simple thing like the fact that on a written exam, the
students write their candidate number on the top of every exam paper, along
with the page number, the course id, date, etc. Granted, most of these fields
are to ensure that if an accident like someone dropping a stack of exams down a
flight of stairs happen, they can be reassembled correctly, which is no longer
an issue with digital exams. Yet the fact still remains that the invigilators
knows to check that the student signed the correct candidate number on each
page. However, in a digital exam as employed by NTNU today, there is no place
to write your candidate number, with the exception of on the paper that is
brought by the invigilators when the exam starts. On the actual exam site, you
sign in using FEIDE. New procedures, however small they might be, still has to
be learned.
