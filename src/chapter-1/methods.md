# Research Method
I do not believe there is any single research method that could adequately
answer the research questions stated in [@sec:rq], thus several research
methods described below were employed.

## Penetration testing
I will be attempting to penetrate the security mechanisms implemented by Inspera
Assessment in their LMS to enforce that students utilize SEB when taking the
exam, as well as getting access to resources I should not have access to while
doing exams in SEB on the Inspera website. This consists of making multiple and
varied attempts at forging information or modifying the code running in my
browser to fool either the Inspera LMS or SEB into doing something that they
were not intended for.
