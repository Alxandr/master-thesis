# Research Method
I do not believe there is any single research method that could adequately
answer the research questions stated in [@sec:rq], thus several research
methods described below were employed.

## Penetration Testing
I will be attempting to penetrate the security mechanisms implemented by Inspera
Assessment in their LMS to enforce that students utilize SEB when taking the
exam, as well as getting access to resources I should not have access to while
doing exams in SEB on the Inspera website. This consists of making multiple and
varied attempts at forging information or modifying the code running in my
browser to fool either the Inspera LMS or SEB into doing something that they
were not intended for.

## Literature Study
With regards to **RQ2**, and how to solve any issues discovered, I will look to
other solutions to the digital exam problem. Digital exams, while not old are
also not entirely new, so there are other cases to look at, and other
educational institutions that have used different methods to give digital exams
to their students. As such I will try to look at other solutions and see if they
can be used to solve our problems.
