In this chapter I will go through the different exploits I've attempted and
discovered. It will focus mostly on the technical side of things, for the most
part ignoring the fact that the exam problem does not need a purely technical
solution, and even if we can find a purely technical exploit, there may be
non-technical reasons that make such an exploit unfeasible. As an example, if
for some reason playing loud music while running Safe Exam Browser would allow
you to access resources you should not be able to otherwise, this would
obviously not be a practical exploit because the invigilators would shut you
down immediately if you attempted to use it during an actual exam. However, in a
purely technical bubble it would still be a perfectly valid exploit. I will
discuss this more in [@sec:technical].
