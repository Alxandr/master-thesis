# Looking to others
NTNU is not the only, nor the first university to attempt to use digital exams,
and other universities across the world has done so using different solutions.
The Lebanese French University in Kurdistan developed their own solution using
normal web technologies and a custom browser implementation written in C#
without the normal close/minimize/maximize buttons normally shown on windows
[@Salim2017]. They claim that by having randomized questions for each student
(delivered from a question database) they can effectively reduce cheating to
almost zero, but do not provide much data to back this claim up. While it's true
that having random questions would prevent the typical "look at another screen"
kind of cheating, it does nothing to mitigate users accessing resources they
should not have access to, online or not.

In the paper "Challenges of Online Exam, Performances and problems for Online
University Exam" they propose using biometric sensors to authenticate users as a
means to prevent cheating. It also proposes having cameras that can view the
entire lecture hall [@Sarrayrih2013]. The biometric sensor might certainly help
prevent students getting other people to take the exam for them, if that is
indeed a problem, yet we already require student ID to be displayed before
starting an exam. While having a camera in the exam room might prove helpful,
it's unlikely to be much more helpful than having invigilators, and it does
provide some privacy issues considering the fact that the footage may be
recorded.
