## Cheating in digital exams
Another thing to look at is how prevalent cheating is in digital exams as
opposed to pen-and-paper exams. There have been multiple studies done on the
topic, and the results are somewhat conflicting. A study on academic honesty and
online learning found no significant differences in cheating behavior of
students between digital and pen-and-paper exams [@Grijalva2006]. Another study
on distance learning the same year found that "most students cheat", and that
they are more likely to cheat online [@Lanier2006]. However, this study covers
student behavior in general, with questions about cheating during a course in
general, not specifically at exams.

A newer study from 2009 found the opposite result, that students were more
likely to cheat on traditional courses than online courses [@Stuber-McEwen2009].
It also had a separate question with regards to cheating on tests, with only a
$0.0013$ probability of students cheating on tests. The sample set is rather
small compared to the other studies though.

A forth study found only a small difference between cheating on live vs. online
classes, with $32.1\%$ cheating on live classes, and $32.7\%$ cheating on online
classes [@Watson2010]. This study also conflates cheating on tests and
assignments. Students were also asked whether they themselves thought that they
and others would be more likely to cheat in online or live classes, in which an
overwhelming majority of the students thought that they or others would be more
likely to cheat in online classes. Since however the data doesn't necessarily
support this, it might be a conception issue, or it may just be that digital
exams are too new so people haven't had the opportunity to cheat with them.
