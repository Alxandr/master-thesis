# Technologies
In this section I will describe the different technologies used in this report,
how different parts of them work, and how they connect together.

## Safe Exam Browser
Safe Exam Browser (SEB) is an application developed to provide what is known as
"safe environments" or more accurately controlled environments to allow students
to take the exam on their own devices. SEB is currently available for both
Windows and Mac users, and it contains several technologies to prevent users
from getting access to things they should not have access to.
