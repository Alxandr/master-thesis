# Technologies
In this section I will describe the different technologies used in this report,
how different parts of them work, and how they connect together.

## Safe Exam Browser
Safe Exam Browser (SEB) is an application developed to provide what is known as
"safe environments" or more accurately controlled environments to allow students
to take the exam on their own devices. SEB is currently available for both
Windows and Mac users, and it contains several technologies to prevent users
from getting access to things they should not have access to. SEB is highly
configurable, allowing the institution/test provider to create a encrypted
configuration file which is used to start the exam. Some of the things that can
be configured:

* Whether or not users should be allowed to exit the exam midway though.
* Whether or not users should be allowed to minimize SEB during the exam (access
  other parts of their computer).
* Whether or not users should be allowed access to the internet (and if so,
  which sites).
* Whether or not SEB should block keyboard shortcuts such as `Alt+F4`.
* A password that should be known only to invigilators allowing preemptive
  exiting of the exam.
* A list of valid root certificates to allow.
* And many many more.

### Windows
The windows version of Safe Exam Browser is written in C# using the .NET
framework. It contains a separate application for running SEB and creating
configuration files. It uses XULRunner as it's browser component.

### Mac
The mac version of Safe Exam Browser is written in Objective-C using the cocoa
framework. The configuration file editor is part of the same application that
runs the browser (you have to start SEB first to edit/author configuration
files). It uses Safari as it's browser component.

## Browser Request Hash
Browser Request Hash is a HTTP header generated by SEB and sent with every
request to any web server to validate that the user is using SEB with the right
configuration and build. SEB generates this value by first generating what it
calls a Browser Exam Key which is then concatenated with the URL of the request
and then hashed using SHA256. The Browser Exam Key itself is generated by
hashing all the files of the current running SEB instance (including it's
browser components) and then combining that with the SEB configuration file in
question. The result is then used to generated a tag using HMAC with SHA256 as
the hash function.

The Browser Exam Key is shared with any LMS with SEB support prior to the exam,
and used by the LMS to validate that the user is in fact using SEB. This is done
by taking the incoming request URL, concatenated it with the Browser Exam Key
(just as SEB does on the client side) and then hashing it with SHA256. Then the
generated request hash is checked against the request hash header transmitted
from SEB, and if they do not match the request is denied.

## XULRunner
XULRunner is a deprecated [@BenjaminSmedberg][@Mozilla] Mozilla runtime package
[@Mozillaa] used to bootstrap feature rich applications such as Firefox and
Thunderbird. SEB for windows uses XULRunner as it's main browser component
to create a chromeless (or custom chromed) browser window inside the kiosk mode
frame that is SEB itself.
