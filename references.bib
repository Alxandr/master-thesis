abstract = {Pressure for better measurement of stated learning outcomes has resulted in a demand for more frequent assessment. The resources available are seen to be static or dwindling, but Information and Communications Technology is seen to increase productivity by automating assessment tasks. This paper reviews computer-assisted assessment (CAA) and suggests future developments. A search was conducted of CAA-related literature from the past decade to trace the development of CAA from the beginnings of its large-scale use in higher education. Lack of resources, individual inertia and risk propensity are key barriers for individual academics, while proper resourcing and cultural factors outweigh technical barriers at the institutional level.},

@techreport{Sindre2015,
abstract = {While many tasks concerning the interaction between students and learning institutions have been successfully digitized, high-stakes examinations remain mainly a traditional paper-based process in most Norwegian learning institutions. A large scale shift towards e-exams can however be expected during the next 5-10 years, based on a number of perceived benefits of digital exams over paper-based exams. From a pedagogical perspective it is important to avoid a too narrow focus on e-exams mainly as a means to save money by making the examination and grading process more efficient, but rather as a possibility for more fundamental process and quality improvement. This paper analyzes what improvements might be possible, and what requirements this would entail for the e-exam system.},

In many cases, these evaluations are unproctored and leave the evaluation prone to ex- ploitation for those willing to cheat. With the growth of the Internet and web based test- ing, these unproctored evaluations are used not only for education, but for prospective employers and governments alike. This thesis aims to look at how cheating threats can be mitigated by using software systems to improve the processes using in web based testing.},

abstract = {This project was conducted to gain a perspective on the topic of the conduction of digital BYOD exams at NTNU, with regard to cheating. The purpose was to assess whether the software, Safe Exam Browser, used to restrict digital access to possible cheating resources, would be sufficient for creating a secure exam environment and mitigate cheating behaviors. The project consisted of a literary review on cheating in higher education and penetration testing of the SEB environ- ment, using research, and threat modeling. There were several vulnerabilities discovered during the project, that could potential give a cheating examinee a significant advantage during a dig- ital exam. These vulnerabilities may be mitigated against by other elements of the digital exam environment that has not been assessed in this project. However, it is important to ensure that institutions, which use digital exam environments during assessment, are properly mitigated against cheating, are aware of possible threats, and have an active strategy to improve mitiga- tion of cheating.},

abstract = {Digital exams are not the most common practice in Norwegian higher education, but it is being tested and used at several institutions. Exams are normally con- ducted on pen and paper with limited access to resources, and it has been a chal- lenge to make an affordable, digital adaption for this type of exams. One approach to create this digital exam environment, is with the use of lock- down browsers on student owned computers. At NTNU they have chosen to use a lock-down browser called Safe Exam Browser, which is continuously being im- proved and is widely used for digital exams. This thesis will look into whether Safe Exam Browser sufficiently protects against cheating during a digital Bring-Your-Own-Device exam. It will be a technical evaluation of Safe Exam Browser as a software, that ensures a secured exam envi- ronment and helps mitigate cheating behaviors. The vulnerabilities of Safe Exam Browser is discovered, evaluated and tested with penetration testing. Safe Exam Browser does have vulnerabilities, and some of them are presented in this thesis. It is open source and for exams conducted at NTNU, it is installed on the examinees' personal computers, and it will always be possible that someone choose to use a corrupted version to be able to cheat. There are different mecha- nisms in this software, to detect and deny access to exams, if the lock-down browser has been modified. These mechanisms make it harder, but not impossible, to make and use a corrupted version.},

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the institution-wide online exams service at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich. It is intended for stakeholders in faculty, administration, IT, and didactic support units who wish to promote and implement a similar service at their own institutions. Based on pedagogical and psychometric considerations, a case is made for how online exam environments can help to improve the quality of examinations in higher education by making performance assessments more accurate and valid, as well as more motivating and meaningful to students. Throughout the subsequent outline of the online exams service at ETH, we focus on identifying the elements critical to fulfilling these aims. This includes a discussion of the organization, development, and operation of the service and the didactic and technical support for examiners. We provide blueprints of our online exam setups, and demonstrate how even complex online exam environments incorporating a mix of applications, files and websites can be made secure. The paper finishes with a discussion and an outlook regarding our current and planned service development projects.},

In our research paper, we discuss the performance of student's online course exam with respect to security and main challenges faced by online course exams within the university. We conclude that by improving the security system using biometrics face recognition that can be incorporated into the proposed system to fulfill the challenge of online exam.},

abstract = {This paper examines potential differences between Korean and American students in terms of their perception levels regarding online education support service quality, online learning acceptance, and satisfaction. Eight hundred and seventy-two samples, which were collected from students in online classes in the United States and Korea, were analyzed using factor analysis, structural equation model techniques, independent sample t-test, and logistic regression. The following results were obtained from this analysis: 1) There were significant differences between the perceptions of Korean and US students with regard to online education support service quality. In this context, Korean students held a significantly higher perception of online support service quality. 2) Perception of online support service quality was a significant predictor of online learning acceptance and satisfaction for both Korean and American students. It appears that a majority of the students in the two countries, irrespective of the differences in their perceptions of online support service quality, believe that the acceptance of online classes would benefit them.},
