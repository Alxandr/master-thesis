This article discusses data obtained over the last three years from over 80,000 students and 12,000 faculty in the United States and Canada. While documenting that cheating on tests and exams and plagiarism are significant issues on our college and university campuses, it also offers some thoughts on possible strategies to encourage greater levels of academic integrity among students.},

abstract = {Computer programs are being used to combat cheating in the classroom. The high levels of cheating among students have come about largely because of permissive seating arrangements in overcrowded rooms, and the use of a single exam paper. Software programs have been developed which can identify cheats. One operates by flagging those individuals with errors in common. The other assesses the number of correct answers against the number of differences in the exam paper for a suspect pair. The accumulated evidence indicates that significant amounts of extreme cheating and partial copying are going on. Both types of cheating can be positively identified. Despite their intrusive nature, simple measures such as seat and examination scrambling are recommended in order to eliminate the problem of cheating in multiple-choice examinations.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of the Internet has brought many good things: electronic commerce, easy access to vast stores of reference material, collaborative computing, e-mail, and new avenues for advertising and information distribution, to name a few. As with most technological advances, there is also a dark side: criminal hackers. Governments, companies, and private citizens around the world are anxious to be a part of this revolution, but they are afraid that some hacker will break into their Web server and replace their logo with pornography, read their e-mail, steal their credit card number from an on-line shopping site, or implant software that will secretly transmit their organization's secrets to the open Internet. With these concerns and others, the ethical hacker can help. This paper describes ethical hackers: their skills, their attitudes, and how they go about helping their customers find and plug up security holes. The ethical hacking process is explained, along with many of the problems that the Global Security Analysis Lab has seen during its early years of ethical hacking for IBM clients.},

abstract = {Although the philosophy of education of many universities began shifted gradually towards using computers and information and communication technologies to establish effective education environment, the traditional style of examinations (that suffering from real problems related to the type of using paper and pen) is still used in these technological environments. The current e-Exam systems that have been used in modern education environment are still suffering from many problems, but in spite they solved some traditional exam problems, the authors highlighted these issues and developed a new e-Exam platform to provide a better quality exam in terms of saving cost, time, effort and cheating probability. The developed e-Exam was implemented upon client/server network architecture on three computer laboratories at the department of IT in LFU. This e-Exam is being used by 14 lecturers to make daily quizzes, midterm and final exams for 142 morning and evening students to replace most of the paper based examinations since October 2015. The developed e-Exam platform includes three main subsystems which are integrated and working together to generate e-Exam Packages and to deliver the e-Examinations. A special e-Exam Browser was implemented using C Sharp to establish the client/server model. A usability test of e-Exam platform and questionnaires for both lecturers and students were carried out to assess satisfaction and effectiveness. Finally, the empirical outcomes were achieved and mentioned in this paper. To the best of our knowledge based to review literature and our e-Exam adoption survey, the implemented platform represents the first official e-Exam platform in Kurdistan Region of Iraq.},

With more and more Internet based course offerings, the concern is whether cheating will increase as students work and take tests away from the eyes of instructors. While the research on academic dishonesty in general is quite extensive, there is very limited research on student cheating in online courses. This study of 635 undergraduate and graduate students at a medium sized university focused on student cheating behaviors in both types of classes (on-line and face to face), by examining cheating behavior and perceptions of whether on-line or traditional face-to-face classes experienced greater cheating behaviors.

abstract = {Students who feel disconnected from others may be prone to engage in deceptive behaviors such as academic dishonesty. George and Carlson (1999) contend that as the distance between a student and a physical classroom setting increases, so too would the frequency of online cheating. The distance that exists between faculty and students through the virtual classroom may contribute to the belief that students enrolled in online classes are more likely to cheat than students enrolled in traditional classroom settings. The prevalence of academic misconduct among students enrolled in online classes was explored. Students (N = 225) were given the Student Academic Dishonesty Survey to determine the frequency and type of academic dishonest behaviors. Results indicated that students enrolled in online classes were less likely to cheat than those enrolled in traditional, on ground courses. Aiding and abetting was self-reported as the most frequently used method among students in both online and traditional classroom settings. Results suggest that the amount of academic misconduct among online students may not be as prevalent as believed.},

Eight hundred and seventy-two samples, which were collected from students in online classes in the United States and Korea, were analyzed using factor analysis, structural equation model techniques, independent sample t-test, and logistic regression. The following results were obtained from this analysis: 1) There were significant differences between the perceptions of Korean and US students with regard to online education support service quality. In this context, Korean students held a significantly higher perception of online support service quality. 2) Perception of online support service quality was a significant predictor of online learning acceptance and satisfaction for both Korean and American students. It appears that a majority of the students in the two countries, irrespective of the differences in their perceptions of online support service quality, believe that the acceptance of online classes would benefit them.},

Throughout the subsequent outline of the online exams service at ETH, we focus on identifying the elements critical to fulfilling these aims. This includes a discussion of the organization, development, and operation of the service and the didactic and technical support for examiners. We provide blueprints of our online exam setups, and demonstrate how even complex online exam environments incorporating a mix of applications, files and websites can be made secure.

The purpose was to assess whether the software, Safe Exam Browser, used to restrict digital access to possible cheating resources, would be sufficient for creating a secure exam environment and mitigate cheating behaviors. The project consisted of a literary review on cheating in higher education and penetration testing of the SEB environ- ment, using research, and threat modeling. There were several vulnerabilities discovered during the project, that could potential give a cheating examinee a significant advantage during a dig- ital exam. These vulnerabilities may be mitigated against by other elements of the digital exam environment that has not been assessed in this project. However, it is important to ensure that institutions, which use digital exam environments during assessment, are properly mitigated against cheating, are aware of possible threats, and have an active strategy to improve mitiga- tion of cheating.},

Exams are normally con- ducted on pen and paper with limited access to resources, and it has been a chal- lenge to make an affordable, digital adaption for this type of exams. One approach to create this digital exam environment, is with the use of lock- down browsers on student owned computers. At NTNU they have chosen to use a lock-down browser called Safe Exam Browser, which is continuously being im- proved and is widely used for digital exams. This thesis will look into whether Safe Exam Browser sufficiently protects against cheating during a digital Bring-Your-Own-Device exam. It will be a technical evaluation of Safe Exam Browser as a software, that ensures a secured exam envi- ronment and helps mitigate cheating behaviors. The vulnerabilities of Safe Exam Browser is discovered, evaluated and tested with penetration testing. Safe Exam Browser does have vulnerabilities, and some of them are presented in this thesis. It is open source and for exams conducted at NTNU, it is installed on the examinees' personal computers, and it will always be possible that someone choose to use a corrupted version to be able to cheat. There are different mecha- nisms in this software, to detect and deny access to exams, if the lock-down browser has been modified. These mechanisms make it harder, but not impossible, to make and use a corrupted version.},
